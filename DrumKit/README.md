# My thoughts on the Drum Kit

## data-key - a data attribute
When someone hits a key on the keyboard it will find an audio element.
Using JavaScript event listener keydown and a function will run.

## keyCode
A number asscoiated with a corresponding key on your keyboard.
This is awemsome!

## querySelector
Selecting 1 key

## querySelectorAll
Multiple selctions


ES6 Template strings = ${}

##Overall Thoughts!
This was a cool exercise. I learned you can add event listeners to corresponding keyboard selections. Using JavaScript to play files and transform buttons with CSS. 

I enjoyed this exercise and look forward to using this knowledge in the future!
