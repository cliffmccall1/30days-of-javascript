# My thoughts on Array Cardio Day 1

Working out to get better with Array Methods!

filter() - will take in information and only put out what meets requirements.

map() - will always return the same amount of items as you give it.

sort() - used for arranging

reduce() - reduces the array to a single value

split() - splits a string into a substrings array and returns the new array.
