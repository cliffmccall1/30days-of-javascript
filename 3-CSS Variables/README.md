# My thoughts on CSS Variables

## Update CSS Variables with JS
CSS variables work by declaring them on some sore of element. In this project on the root.
-- is the standard in CSS to grab an element. So it's backwards compatable with older browsers.

querySelectorAll() - will return a NodeList not an array.

## data attribute
data-something
In this project data-sizing = "px"

## dataset
Is an object that will contain all the data attributes from that specific element. In this case sizing.

## Notes
When you use a CSS variable you can update that variable on any element, and any selectors that are inside that element.
