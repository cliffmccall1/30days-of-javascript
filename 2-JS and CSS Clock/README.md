# My thoughts on the Clock

This was a neat exercise using JavaScript and CSS to have an analog clock face.

querySelector was used to target css classes to transform the object each second, minute or hour.

Played around more with the CSS even tho this is a JavaScript challenge.
I wanted the hands to be more unique and added a center piece to help it look more round in the center of the clock. 

## Notes
I've never done this before in a console.log, but I thought it was cool to see the time print out while watching the clock.
console.log(hours + ':' + mins + ':' + seconds);

I want to come back and create a an if/else statement to stop the weird transition at 90 degrees.
