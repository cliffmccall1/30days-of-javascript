# 30days-of-javascript
## By Wes Bos
This is my journey through the #30 Days of JavaScript by Wes Bos to further my knowledge of JavaScript. I believe each exercise uses vanilla JavaScript only.

I will be using his start up files for each day and following along with videos Wes Bos provided. The goal is to also 
provide a ReadMe file with each project to notate what I learned with each exercise. 

If you wish to do the course yourself follow the links below!
